# Query Data with Similarity Searches

Use Oracle AI Vector Search native SQL operations from your development environment to combine similarity with relational searches.

-   **[Perform Exact Similarity Search](GUID-CCCF06F5-AD46-466D-99B2-4609B84C2B69.md)**  
A similarity search looks for the relative order of vectors compared to a query vector. Naturally, the comparison is done using a particular distance metric but what is important is the result set of your top closest vectors, not the distance between them.
-   **[Perform Approximate Similarity Search Using Vector Indexes](GUID-D8432ADA-38B0-4E5F-975F-E86977CA8488.md)**  
For a vector search to be useful, it needs to be fast and accurate. Approximate similarity searches seek a balance between these goals.
-   **[Perform Multi-Vector Similarity Search](GUID-F5ACF1FB-87C8-4051-872D-63E408480EC8.md)**  
Another major use-case of vector search is multi-vector search. Multi-vector search is typically associated with a multi-document search, where documents are split into chunks that are individually embedded into vectors.
-   **[Perform Combined Similarity and Text Search](GUID-B2AFB10D-7490-49A2-9E19-F980AA15818C.md)**  
Use a hybrid vector index to perform vector similarity along with full text search on textual or data columns.
