This diagram illustrates how in an approximate search for a query vector `vq`â€‹, the search algorithm identifies the nearest `i` centroids, where `i` defaults to the square root of `k` but can be adjusted for a specific query by setting the NEIGHBOR PROBES parameter. This adjustment allows for a trade-off between search speed and accuracy.
