# **Optimizer Plans for Vector Indexes**

Optimizer plans for HNSW and IVF indexes are described in the following sections.

-   **[Optimizer Plans for HNSW Vector Indexes](GUID-7D6B60D4-5A0C-4E9F-963E-81E244F2847A.md)**  
A Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graph \(HNSW\) is a form of In-Memory Neighbor Graph vector index. It is a very efficient index for vector approximate similarity search.
-   **[Optimizer Plans for IVF Vector Indexes](GUID-D3DF07F9-F75C-4BD8-937E-94DD1072BED3.md)**  
Inverted File Flat \(IVF\) is a form of Neighbor Partition Vector index. It is a partition-based index that achieves search efficiency by narrowing the search area through the use of neighbor partitions or clusters.
