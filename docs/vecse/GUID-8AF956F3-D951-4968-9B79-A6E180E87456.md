# Create Vector Indexes

You may want to create vector indexes on your vector embeddings and use these indexes for running similarity searches over huge vector spaces.

Vector indexes are a class of specialized indexing data structures that are designed to accelerate similarity searches using high-dimensional vectors. They use techniques such as clustering, partitioning, and neighbor graphs to group vectors representing similar items, which drastically reduces the search space, thereby making the search process extremely efficient.

To allow vector index creation, you must enable a new memory area stored in the SGA called the Vector Pool.
