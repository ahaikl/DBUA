# Convert Text String to Summary

You can extract a concise summary from large and complex documents.

You can see how to access third-party text summarization models to perform a text-to-summary transformation, by using the `DBMS_VECTOR_CHAIN.UTL_TO_SUMMARY` API.

1.  Start SQL\*Plus and connect to Oracle Database as a local test user.

    1.  Log in to SQL\*Plus as the `sys` user, connecting as `sysdba`, to a pluggable database \(PDB\) within your multitenant container database \(CDB\):

        ```
        conn sys/password@CDB_PDB as sysdba
        ```

        ```
        CREATE TABLESPACE tbs1
        DATAFILE 'tbs5.dbf' SIZE 20G AUTOEXTEND ON
        EXTENT MANAGEMENT LOCAL
        SEGMENT SPACE MANAGEMENT AUTO;
        ```

    2.  Create a local test user \(`docuser`\) and grant necessary privileges:

        ```
        DROP USER docuser cascade;
        ```

        ```
        CREATE USER docuser identified by docuser DEFAULT TABLESPACE tbs1 quota unlimited on tbs1;
        ```

        ```
        GRANT DB_DEVELOPER_ROLE, create credential to docuser;
        ```

    3.  Connect to Oracle Database as the test user and alter the environment settings for your session:

        ```
        CONN docuser/password@CDB_PDB
        ```

        ```
        SET ECHO ON
        SET FEEDBACK 1
        SET NUMWIDTH 10
        SET LINESIZE 80
        SET TRIMSPOOL ON
        SET TAB OFF
        SET PAGESIZE 10000
        SET LONG 10000
        ```

    4.  Set the HTTP proxy server if configured:

        ```
        EXEC UTL_HTTP.SET_PROXY('<proxy-hostname\>:<proxy-port\>');
        ```

    5.  Grant connect privilege for a host using the `DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN` procedure. This example uses `*` to allow any host. However, you can explicitly specify each host that you want to connect to.

        ```
        BEGIN
          DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN.APPEND_HOST_ACE(
            host => '*',
            ace => xs$ace_type(privilege_list => xs$name_list('connect'),
                               principal_name => 'docuser',
                               principal_type => xs_acl.ptype_db));
        END;
        /
        ```

2.  Set up your credentials for the REST provider that you want to access and then call `UTL_TO_SUMMARY`:

    -   **Using Cohere, Google AI, Hugging Face, OpenAI, and Vertex AI**:

        1.  Run `DBMS_VECTOR_CHAIN.CREATE_CREDENTIAL` to create and store a credential.

            Cohere, Google AI, Hugging Face, OpenAI, and Vertex AI require the following authentication parameter:

            `{ "access_token": "<access token\>" }`

            You will later refer to this credential name when declaring JSON parameters for the `UTL_TO_SUMMARY` call.

            ```
            exec dbms_vector_chain.drop_credential('<credential name\>');
            ```

            ```
            declare
              jo json_object_t;
            begin
              jo := json_object_t();
              jo.put('access_token', '<access token\>');
              dbms_vector_chain.create_credential(
                credential_name   => '<credential name\>',
                params            => json(jo.to_string));
            end;
            /
            ```

            Replace the `access_token` and `credential_name` values. For example:

            ```
            declare
              jo json_object_t;
            begin
              jo := json_object_t();
              jo.put('access_token', 'AbabA1B123aBc123AbabAb123a1a2ab');
              dbms_vector_chain.create_credential(
                credential_name   => 'HF_CRED',
                params            => json(jo.to_string));
            end;
            /
            ```

        2.  Run `DBMS_VECTOR_CHAIN.UTL_TO_SUMMARY`:

            ```
            *-- select example*
            
            var params clob;
            exec :params := '
            {
              "provider": "<REST provider\>",
              "credential_name": "<credential name\>",
              "url": "<REST endpoint URL for text summarization service\>",
              "model": "<REST provider text summarization model name\>"
            }';
            
            select dbms_vector_chain.utl_to_summary(
              'A transaction is a logical, atomic unit of work that contains one or more SQL
                statements.
                An RDBMS must be able to group SQL statements so that they are either all
                committed, which means they are applied to the database, or all rolled back, which
                means they are undone.
                An illustration of the need for transactions is a funds transfer from a savings account to
                a checking account. The transfer consists of the following separate operations:
                1. Decrease the savings account.
                2. Increase the checking account.
                3. Record the transaction in the transaction journal.
                Oracle Database guarantees that all three operations succeed or fail as a unit. For
                example, if a hardware failure prevents a statement in the transaction from executing,
                then the other statements must be rolled back.
                Transactions set Oracle Database apart from a file system. If you
                perform an atomic operation that updates several files, and if the system fails halfway
                through, then the files will not be consistent. In contrast, a transaction moves an
                Oracle database from one consistent state to another. The basic principle of a
                transaction is "all or nothing": an atomic operation succeeds or fails as a whole.', 
              json(:params)) from dual;
            
            *-- PL/SQL example*
            
            declare
              input clob;
              params clob;
              output clob;
            begin
              input := 'A transaction is a logical, atomic unit of work that contains one or more SQL

              params := '
            {

              "credential_name": "<credential name\>",

              output := dbms_vector_chain.utl_to_summary(input, json(params));
              dbms_output.put_line(output);
              if output is not null then
                dbms_lob.freetemporary(output);
              end if;
            exception
              when OTHERS THEN
                DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (SQLERRM);
                DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (SQLCODE);
            end;
            /
            ```

            Replace the `provider`, `credential_name`, `url`, and `model` values. Optionally, you can specify additional REST provider parameters.

            Cohere example:

            ```
            {
              "provider": "cohere",
              "credential_name": "COHERE_CRED",
              "url": "https://api.cohere.example.com/summarize",
              "model": "summarize-model",
              "length": "medium",
              "format": "paragraph",
              "temperature": 1.0
            }
            ```

            Google AI example:

            ```
            {
              "provider": "googleai",
              "credential_name": "GOOGLEAI_CRED",
              "url": "https://googleapis.example.com/models/",
              "model": "summarize-model",
              "generation_config": {
                "temperature": 0.9,
                "topP": 1,
                "candidateCount": 1,
                "maxOutputTokens": 256
              }
            }
            ```

            Hugging Face example:

            ```
            {
              "provider": "huggingface",
              "credential_name": "HF_CRED",
              "url": "https://api.huggingface.example.co/models/",
              "model": "summarize-model",
              "wait_for_model": "true"
            }
            ```

            OpenAI example:

            ```
            {
              "provider": "openai",
              "credential_name": "OPENAI_CRED",
              "url": "https://api.openai.example.com",
              "model": "summarize-model",
              "max_tokens": 256,
              "temperature": 1.0
            }
            ```

            Vertex AI example:

            ```
            {
              "provider": "vertexai",
              "credential_name": "VERTEXAI_CRED",
              "url": "https://googleapis.example.com/models/",
              "model": "summarize-model",
              "generation_config": {
                "temperature": 0.9,
                "topP": 1,
                "candidateCount": 1,
                "maxOutputTokens": 256
              }
            }
            ```

    -   **Using Generative AI**:

        1.  Run `DBMS_VECTOR_CHAIN.CREATE_CREDENTIAL` to create and store an OCI credential \(`OCI_CRED`\).

            Generative AI requires the following authentication parameters:

            ```
            { 
            "user_ocid": "<user ocid\>",
            "tenancy_ocid": "<tenancy ocid\>",
            "compartment_ocid": "<compartment ocid\>",
            "private_key": "<private key\>",
            "fingerprint": "<fingerprint\>" 
            }
            ```

            You will later refer to this credential name when declaring JSON parameters for the `UTL_TO_SUMMARY` call.

            **Note:**

            The generated private key may appear as:

            ```
            -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
            <private key string\>
            -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
            ```

            You pass the `<private key string\>` value \(excluding the `BEGIN` and `END` lines\), either as a single line or as multiple lines.

            ```
            exec dbms_vector_chain.drop_credential('OCI_CRED');
            ```

            ```
            declare
              jo json_object_t;
            begin
              jo := json_object_t();
              jo.put('user_ocid','<user ocid\>');
              jo.put('tenancy_ocid','<tenancy ocid\>');
              jo.put('compartment_ocid','<compartment ocid\>');
              jo.put('private_key','<private key\>');
              jo.put('fingerprint','<fingerprint\>');
              dbms_output.put_line(jo.to_string);
              dbms_vector_chain.create_credential(
                credential_name   => 'OCI_CRED',
                params            => json(jo.to_string));
            end;
            /
            ```

            Replace all the authentication parameter values.

            For example:

            ```
            declare
              jo json_object_t;
            begin
              jo := json_object_t();
              jo.put('user_ocid','ocid1.user.oc1..aabbalbbaa1112233aabbaabb1111222aa1111bb');
              jo.put('tenancy_ocid','ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaalbbbb1112233aaaabbaa1111222aaa111a');
              jo.put('compartment_ocid','ocid1.compartment.oc1..ababalabab1112233abababab1111222aba11ab');
              jo.put('private_key','AAAaaaBBB11112222333...AAA111AAABBB222aaa1a/+');
              jo.put('fingerprint','01:1a:a1:aa:12:a1:12:1a:ab:12:01:ab:a1:12:ab:1a');
              dbms_output.put_line(jo.to_string);
              dbms_vector_chain.create_credential(
                credential_name   => 'OCI_CRED',
                params            => json(jo.to_string));
            end;
            /
            ```

        2.  Run `DBMS_VECTOR_CHAIN.UTL_TO_SUMMARY`:

            ```
            *-- select example*

                transaction is all or nothing: an atomic operation succeeds or fails as a whole.';
            
              params := '
            {
              "provider": "ocigenai",
              "credential_name": "OCI_CRED",
              "url": "<REST endpoint URL for text summarization service\>",
              "model": "<REST provider text summarization model name\>"
            }';
            
              output := dbms_vector_chain.utl_to_summary(input, json(params));
              dbms_output.put_line(output);
              if output is not null then
                dbms_lob.freetemporary(output);
              end if;
            exception
              when OTHERS THEN
                DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (SQLERRM);
                DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE (SQLCODE);
            end;
            /
            ```

            Replace the `url` and `model` values. Optionally, you can specify additional REST provider-specific parameters.

            For example:

            ```
            {  
             "provider": "ocigenai",
              "credential_name": "OCI_CRED",
              "url": "https://generativeai.oci.example.com/summarizeText",
              "model": "summarize.modelname",
              "length": "MEDIUM",
              "format": "PARAGRAPH",
              "temperature": 1.0
            }
            ```

    The generated summary appears as follows:

    ```
    A transaction is a logical unit of work that groups one or more SQL statements
    that must be executed as a unit, with all statements succeeding, or all
    statements being rolled back. Transactions are a fundamental concept in
    relational database management systems (RDBMS), and Oracle Database is
    specifically designed to manage transactions, ensuring database consistency and
    integrity. Transactions differ from file systems in that they maintain
    atomicity, ensuring that all related operations succeed or fail as a whole,
    maintaining database consistency regardless of intermittent failures.
    Transactions move a database from one consistent state to another, and the
    fundamental principle is that a transaction is committed or rolled back as a
    whole, upholding the "all or nothing" principle.
