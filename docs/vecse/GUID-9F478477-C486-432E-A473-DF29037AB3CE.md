# V$VECTOR\_MEMORY\_POOL

This view contains information about the space allocation for Vector Memory.

The Vector Memory Pool area is used primarily to maintain in-memory vector indexes or metadata useful for vector-related operations. The Vector Memory Pool is subdivided into two pools: a 1MB pool used to store In-Memory Neighbor Graph Index allocations; and a 64K pool used to store metadata. The amount of available memory in each pool is visible in the `V$VECTOR_MEMORY_POOL` view. The relative size of the two pools is determined by internal heuristics. The size of the Vector Memory Pool is controlled by the vector\_memory\_size parameter. Area in the Vector Memory Pool is also allocated to accelerate Neighbor Partition Index access by storing centroid vectors.

|Column Name|Data Type|Description|
|-----------|---------|-----------|
|`POOL`

|`VARCHAR2(26)`

|Name of the pools in the Vector Memory Pool \(64K or 1MB\)

|
|`ALLOC_BYTES`

|`NUMBER`

|Total amount of memory allocated to this pool

|
|`USED_BYTES`

|`NUMBER`

|Amount of memory currently used in this pool

|
|`POPULATE_STATUS`

|`VARCHAR2(26)`

|Status of the vector memory storeâ€”whether it is being populated, is done populating etc.

|
|`CON_ID`

|`NUMBER`

|The ID of the container to which the data pertains. Possible values are:

-   `0`: This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to the entire multitenant container database \(CDB\). This value is also used for rows in non-CDBs.
-   `1`: This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to only the root.
-   `n`: Where `n` is the applicable container ID for the rows containing data.

|

## Example

```
select CON_ID, POOL, ALLOC_BYTES/1024/1024 as ALLOC_BYTES_MB,
USED_BYTES/1024/1024 as USED_BYTES_MB
from V$VECTOR_MEMORY_POOL order by 1,2;


    CON_ID POOL             ALLOC_BYTES_MB USED_BYTES_MB
---------- ---------------- -------------- -------------
         1 1MB POOL                    319             0
         1 64KB POOL                   144             0
         1 IM POOL METADATA             32            32
         2 1MB POOL                    320             0
         2 64KB POOL                   144             0
         2 IM POOL METADATA             16            16
         3 1MB POOL                    320             0
         3 64KB POOL                   144             0
         3 IM POOL METADATA             16            16
         4 1MB POOL                    320             0
         4 64KB POOL                   144             0
         4 IM POOL METADATA             16            16
