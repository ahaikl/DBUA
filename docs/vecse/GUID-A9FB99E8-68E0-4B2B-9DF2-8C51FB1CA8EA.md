# Use PL/SQL Packages to Generate Embeddings

Choose to implement Vector Utility PL/SQL packages to perform chunking, embedding, and text generation operations along with text processing and similarity search, within and outside Oracle Database.

Vector Utility PL/SQL APIs work with both the ONNX embedding models \(loaded into the database\) and third-party REST providers, such as Cohere, Google AI, Hugging Face, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure \(OCI\) Generative AI, OpenAI, or Vertex AI. You can create, run, and schedule end-to-end data transformation and search pipelines.

These packages are made up of subprograms, such as *chainable utility functions* and *vector helper procedures*.

-   **[Terms of Using Vector Utility PL/SQL Packages](GUID-67609313-2A2F-4F08-8A0A-51613B6400FB.md)**  
You must understand the terms of using REST APIs that are part of Vector Utility PL/SQL packages.
-   **[About Chainable Utility Functions and Common Use Cases](GUID-63773EF5-071E-4C02-9EC9-D4E0BA2CE2A2.md)**  
These are intended to be a set of chainable and flexible "stages" through which you pass your input data to transform into a different representation, including vectors.
-   **[About Vector Helper Procedures](GUID-E97EE03F-C922-4C2D-82A7-38152CBF70EB.md)**  
Vector helper procedures let you configure authentication credentials and language-specific data, for use in chainable utility functions.
-   **[Supplied Vector Utility PL/SQL Packages](GUID-D73320C0-C2E3-4B67-A7C9-C0490DC9DE6C.md)**  
Use either a lightweight `DBMS_VECTOR` package or a more advanced `DBMS_VECTOR_CHAIN` package with full capabilities.
-   **[Supported Third-Party Provider Operations](GUID-BE3EE403-CD10-4708-A15F-EFB1FA69DF09.md)**  
Review the list of third-party REST providers that are supported with Vector Utility PL/SQL packages and the corresponding API calls allowed for each of those.
-   **[Validate JSON Input Parameters](GUID-BD911C3C-D17F-4A8D-90BF-5A82A604D7C8.md)**  
You can optionally validate the structure of your JSON input to the `DBMS_VECTOR.UTL` and `DBMS_VECTOR_CHAIN.UTL` functions, which use JSON to define their input parameters.
