# Work with Retrieval Augmented Generation

Oracle AI Vector Search supports Enterprise Retrieval Augmented Generation \(RAG\) to enable sophisticated queries that can combine vectors with relational data, graph data, spatial data, and JSON collections. By communicating with LLMs through the implementation of RAG, the knowledge of LLMs is increased with business data found through AI Vector Search.

Using Retrieval Augmented Generation \(RAG\) can mitigate the inaccuracies and hallucinations faced when using Large Language Models \(LLMs\). Oracle AI Vector Search enables RAG through the use of popular frameworks and PL/SQL APIs.

This scenario allows you to run a similarity search for specific documentation content based on a user query. Once documentation chunks are retrieved, they are concatenated and a prompt is generated to ask an LLM to answer the user question using retrieved chunks.
