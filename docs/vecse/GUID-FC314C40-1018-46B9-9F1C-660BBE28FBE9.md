# Inverted File Flat Index Syntax and Parameter

Syntax for Inverted File Flat Index

## Syntax

```
CREATE VECTOR INDEX <vector index name>
ON <table name> ( <vector column> )
[GLOBAL] ORGANIZATION NEIGHBOR PARTITIONS
[WITH] [DISTANCE <metric name>]
[WITH TARGET ACCURACY <percentage value> 
[PARAMETERS ( TYPE IVF, { NEIGHBOR PARTITIONS <number of partitions> | SAMPLE_PER_PARTITION
    <number of samples> | MIN_VECTORS_PER_PARTITION <minimum number of vectors per partition>
})]]
[PARALLEL <degree of parallelism>];
```

## Parameter

NEIGHBOR PARTITIONS determines the target number of centroid partitions that are created by the index.

SAMPLE\_PER\_PARTITION decides the total number of vectors that are passed to the clustering algorithm \(samples\_per\_partition \* neighbor\_partitions\). Passing all the vectors could significantly increase the total index creation time. The goal is to pass in a subset of vectors that can capture the data distribution.

MIN\_VECTORS\_PER\_PARTITION represents the target minimum number of vectors per partition. The goal is to trim out any partition that can end up with few vectors \(<= 100\).

The valid range for IVF vector index parameters are:

-   `ACCURACY`: \> 0 and <= 100
-   `DISTANCE`: EUCLIDEAN, L2\_SQUARED \(aka EUCLIDEAN\_SQUARED\), COSINE, DOT, MANHATTAN, HAMMING
-   `TYPE`: IVF
-   `NEIGHBOR PARTITIONS`: \>0 and <= 10000000
-   `SAMPLE_PER_PARTITION`: from 1 to \(num\_vectors/neighbor\_partitions\)
-   `MIN_VECTORS_PER_PARTITION`: from 0 \(no trimming of centroid partitions\) to total number of vectors \(would result in 1 centroid partition\)

## Examples

```
CREATE VECTOR INDEX galaxies_ivf_idx ON galaxies (embedding) ORGANIZATION NEIGHBOR PARTITIONS
DISTANCE COSINE
WITH TARGET ACCURACY 95;

CREATE VECTOR INDEX galaxies_ivf_idx ON galaxies (embedding) ORGANIZATION NEIGHBOR PARTITIONS
DISTANCE COSINE
WITH TARGET ACCURACY 90 PARAMETERS (type IVF, neighbor partitions 10);

```
