# About Chainable Utility Functions and Common Use Cases

These are intended to be a set of chainable and flexible "stages" through which you pass your input data to transform into a different representation, including vectors.

## Supplied Chainable Utility Functions

You can combine a set of chainable utility \(`UTL`\) functions together in an end-to-end pipeline.

Each pipeline or transformation chain can include a single function or a combination of functions, which are applied to source documents as they are transformed into other representations \(text, chunks, summary, or vector\). These functions are chained together, such that the output from one function is used as an input for the next.

Each chainable utility function performs a specific task of transforming data into other representations, such as converting data to text, converting text to chunks, or converting the extracted chunks to embeddings.

At a high level, the supplied chainable utility functions include:

|Function

|Description

|
|----------|-------------|
|`UTL_TO_TEXT()`

|Converts a document \(for example, MS Word, HTML, or PDF\) to plain text

|
|`UTL_TO_CHUNKS()`

|Converts plain text to chunks

|
|`UTL_TO_EMBEDDING()`

|Converts plain text to a single embedding \(`VECTOR`\)

|
|`UTL_TO_EMBEDDINGS()`

|Converts an array of chunks \(`VECTOR_ARRAY_T`\) to an array of embeddings \(`VECTOR_ARRAY_T`\)

|
|`UTL_TO_SUMMARY()`

|Converts plain text to a summary

|
|`UTL_TO_GENERATE_TEXT()`

|Generates text for a prompt or input string

|

## Sequence of Chains

Chainable utility functions are designed to be flexible and modular. You can create transformation chains in various sequences, depending on your use case.

For example, you can directly extract vectors from a PDF file by creating a chain of the `UTL_TO_TEXT`, `UTL_TO_CHUNKS`, and `UTL_TO_EMBEDDINGS` chainable utility functions.

As shown in the following diagram, a *file-to-text-to-chunks-to-embeddings* chain performs a set of operations in this order:

1.  Converts a PDF file to plain text \(using `UTL_TO_TEXT`\)
2.  Splits the resulting text into appropriate-sized chunks \(using `UTL_TO_CHUNKS`\)
3.  Generates vector embeddings on each chunk \(using `UTL_TO_EMBEDDINGS`\)

## Common Use Cases

Let us look at some common use cases to understand how you can customize and apply these chains:

**Single-Step or Direct Transformation**:

-   **Document to vectors**:

    As discussed earlier, a common use case might be to automatically generate vectors from documents.

    You can convert a set of documents to plain text, split the resulting text into smaller chunks to finally generate embeddings on each chunk, in a single *file-to-text-to-chunks-to-embeddings* chain.

    See [Convert File to Embeddings](GUID-04C88292-0A04-44F6-8FB4-DDCA5CE38856.md#).

-   **Document to vectors, with chunking and summarization**:

    Another use case might be to generate a short summary of a document and then automatically extract vectors from that summary.

    After generating the summary, you can either generate a single vector \(using `UTL_TO_EMBEDDING`\) or chunk it and then generate multiple vectors \(using `UTL_TO_EMBEDDINGS`\).

    -   You can convert the document to plain text, summarize the text into a concise gist to finally create a single embedding on the summarized text, in a *file-to-text-to-summary-to-embedding* chain.

    -   You can convert the document to plain text, summarize the text into a gist, split the gist into chunks to finally create multiple embeddings on each summarized chunk, in a *file-to-text-to-summary-to-chunks-to-embeddings* chain.

    While both the chunking and summarization techniques make text smaller, they do so in different ways. Chunking just breaks the text into smaller pieces, whereas summarization extracts a salient meaning and context of that text into free-form paragraphs or bullet points.

    By summarizing the entire document and appending the summary to each chunk, you get the best of both worlds, that is, an individual piece that also has a high-level understanding of the overall document.

-   **Prompt to text**:

    You can generate a response directly based on a prompt.

    A prompt can be an input string, such as a question that you ask a Large Language Model \(LLM\). For example, "`What is Oracle Text?`". A prompt can also be a command, such as "`Summarize the following ...`", "`Draft an email asking for ...`", or "`Rewrite the following ...`", and can include results from a search.

    See [Generate Text for a Prompt: PL/SQL Example](GUID-74B1916B-8B3F-43A0-9C80-53A068A639D2.md#).


**Step-by-Step or Parallel Transformation**:

-   **Text to vector**:

    A common use case might be information retrieval applications or chatbots, where you can on the fly generate an embedding from a user's natural language text query.

    You can convert the input text to a query vector \(and then run it against the vector index for a fast similarity search\), in a *text-to-embedding* chain.

    See [Convert Text String to Embedding](GUID-1F9E9C73-6118-427E-8FB7-D4EBCCECC6D0.md#).

-   **Text to chunks**:

    Another use case might be to build a standalone Text Chunking system to break down a large amount of text into smaller yet semantically meaningful pieces, in a *text-to-chunks* chain.

    This method also gives you more flexibility to experiment with your chunks, where you can create, inspect, and accordingly amend the chunking results and then proceed further.

    See [Convert Text to Chunks With Custom Chunking Specifications](GUID-E6771B78-5FB4-4EBA-92F5-BE9FF2DF6AFA.md#) and [Convert File to Text to Chunks to Embeddings](GUID-10D0A76C-2DAE-42BE-A332-3EEF6D91D701.md#).

-   **Text to summary**:

    You can build a standalone Text Summarization system to convert a large amount of text into a summary, in a *text-to-summary* chain.

    This method also gives you more flexibility to experiment with your summaries, where you can create, inspect, and accordingly amend the summarization results and then proceed further.

    See [Convert Text String to Summary](GUID-915112EE-3681-4765-8B3F-F21313EE4878.md#).


## Schedule Vector Utility Packages

Some of the transformation chains may take a long time depending on your workload and implementation, thus you can schedule to run Vector Utility PL/SQL packages in the background.

The `DBMS_SCHEDULER` PL/SQL package helps you effectively schedule these packages, without manual intervention.

For information on how to create, run, and manage jobs with Oracle Scheduler, see [*Oracle Database Administratorâ€™s Guide*](olink:ADMIN-GUID-CAC644C1-854D-44FB-8FF6-BE6DDE809B4F).
