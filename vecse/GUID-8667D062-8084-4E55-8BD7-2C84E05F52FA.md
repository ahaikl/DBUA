# Vector Distance Functions

A vector distance function takes in two vector operands and a distance metric to compute a mathematical distance between those two vectors based on the distance metric provided. Distances determine similarity or dissimilarity between vectors.

Measuring distances in a vector space is at the heart of identifying the most relevant results for a given query vector. That process is very different from the well-known keyword filtering in the relational database world.

`VECTOR_DISTANCE()` is the main function that allows you to calculate distances between two vectors.
