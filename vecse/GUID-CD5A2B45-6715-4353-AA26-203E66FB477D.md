This diagram shows a utility chain for a file-to-text-to-chunks-to-embeddings transformation. It is shown that first a PDF file is transformed into a text file \(using the `UTL_TO_TEXT` function\), then the resulting Text is transformed into Chunks \(using the `UTL_TO_CHUNKS` function\), and then the Chunks are transformed into Embeddings \(using the `UTL_TO_EMBEDDINGS` function\).
