This diagram illustrates how a Hierarchical Navigable Small World \(HNSW\) graph uses the same principal as a Probability Skip List structure with Navigable Small World layers where you find greater distances between vectors in the higher layers. At the top layer are the longest edges and at the bottom layer are the shortest ones.
