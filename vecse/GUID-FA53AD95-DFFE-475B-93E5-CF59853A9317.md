# Load Binary Vector Data Using SQL\*Loader Example

In this example, you can see how to use SQL\*Loader to load binary vector data files.

The vectors in a binary \(`fvec`\) file are stored in raw 32-bit Little Endian format.

Each vector takes 4+d\*4 bytes for the `.fvecs` file where the first 4 bytes indicate the dimensionality \(d\) of the vector \(that is, the number of dimensions in the vector\) followed by d\*4 bytes representing the vector data, as described in the following table:

|Field|Field Type|Description|
|-----|----------|-----------|
|`d`

|int|The vector dimension|
|components

|array of floats

|The vector components

|

For binary `fvec` files, they must be defined as follows:

-   You must specify `LOBFILE`.
-   You must specify the syntax format `fvecs` to indicate that the dafafile contains binary dimensions.
-   You must specify that the datafile contains raw binary data \(`raw`\).

The following is an example of a control file used to load `VECTOR` columns from binary floating point arrays using the galaxies vector example described in [Understand Hierarchical Navigable Small World Indexes](olink:VECSE-GUID-23E74FFC-B6A5-4374-9813-F2634AC43410), but in this case importing `fvecs` data, using the control file syntax `format "fvecs"`:

**Note:**

SQL\*Loader supports loading `VECTOR` columns from character data and binary floating point array `fvec` files. The format for `fvec` files is that each binary 32-bit floating point array is preceded by a four \(4\) byte value, which is the number of elements in the vector. There can be multiple vectors  in the file, possibly with different dimensions.

```
LOAD DATA
infile 'galaxies_vec.csv'
INTO TABLE galaxies
fields terminated by ':'
trailing nullcols
(
id,
name char (50),
doc  char (500),
embedding lobfile (constant '/u01/data/vector/embedding.fvecs' format "fvecs")  raw
)
```

The data contained in `galaxies_vec.csv` in this case does not have the vector data. Instead, the vector data will be read from the secondary `LOBFILE` in the `/u01/data/vector` directory \(`/u01/data/vector/embedding.fvecs`\), which contains the same information in `float32` floating point binary numbers, but is in `fvecs` format:

```
1:M31:Messier 31 is a barred spiral galaxy in the Andromeda constellation which has a lot of barred spiral galaxies.:
2:M33:Messier 33 is a spiral galaxy in the Triangulum constellation.:
3:M58:Messier 58 is an intermediate barred spiral galaxy in the Virgo constellation.:
4:M63:Messier 63 is a spiral galaxy in the Canes Venatici constellation.:
5:M77:Messier 77 is a barred spiral galaxy in the Cetus constellation.:
6:M91:Messier 91 is a barred spiral galaxy in the Coma Berenices constellation.:
7:M49:Messier 49 is a giant elliptical galaxy in the Virgo constellation.:
8:M60:Messier 60 is an elliptical galaxy in the Virgo constellation.:
9:NGC1073:NGC 1073 is a barred spiral galaxy in Cetus constellation.:
